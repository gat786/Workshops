3. **Requirements:**
    
    Before you get started with hosting your very own MSInspir workshop there are a couple of requirements needed from every applicant which are as follows:

4. **Presentation slides**
   
    Your slides are the very foundation of your workshop. The content of the 
    workshop is totally on you and you decide how you want the workshop to 
    roll out. However, please make sure of the following as you design your 
    content:

    * Your slides shouldn't have silly spelling mistakes and if there are any 
    dont worry our team will help you get past it as we verify every content 
    that is going to be here.

    * If you are utilizing any content from another source please make sure to add references.

    * Please avoid any incorrect information and utilize proper verified data.
  
5. **Code & repositories:**
   
    If your workshop includes any coding of sorts please do add it in your 
    slides (if possible) or create an accessible repository that attendees 
    who join your workshop can see all the amazing work that you do. We highly 
    recommend that you share these codes and repositories to the MSInspir team 
    so they can make sure your work is the talk of the day.

6. **Blogs & articles:**
   
    If you‚Äôre a tech savvy person that loves to share their work through 
    blogs and articles then share away! Make sure you provide links to your 
    articles and blogs so that others can learn from your work. This is 
    another way to ensure a large audience to give claps to all of your 
    hard work.

7. **Resources:**
   
    During the conclusion of any workshop, the audience wants to know the 
    answer to the big question ‚ÄúWhere can we learn this all?‚Äù. So make sure 
    you share valuable learning resources that provide a full in depth intel 
    on the topic on which you delivered your workshop. However, keep in 
    mind of the following:
    Your resources should be from verified platforms that legally provide easy 
    to access learning materials.
